                            <p>When I joined Octagos Health as Sr. Director of Strategy & Finance, the healthcare B2B SaaS company was experiencing challenges in revenue operations. The company lacked a structured sales process, had limited visibility into the pipeline, and suffered from disconnected objectives across teams. With ambitious growth targets, there was an urgent need to establish a cohesive revenue operations infrastructure.</p>

                            <p>I developed a comprehensive revenue operations transformation strategy centered on three key pillars:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Sales Process Infrastructure:</strong> Built a structured CRM system and established a clear sales funnel with defined stages and conversion metrics.</li>
                                <li><strong>Cross-Functional Alignment:</strong> Established shared objectives for growth, LTV, and CAC across sales, marketing, product, customer success, and finance teams.</li>
                                <li><strong>Data-Driven Decision Making:</strong> Developed KPIs and dashboards to provide actionable insights to both the teams executing the work and C-Suite leadership.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                            <h3>Implementation</h3>
                            <p>The revenue operations transformation was executed in three phases over 6 months:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Phase 1:</strong> Conducted comprehensive sales process audit and developed CRM implementation roadmap with executive alignment (1 month)</li>
                                <li><strong>Phase 2:</strong> Built and deployed CRM system with customized sales funnel stages and established cross-functional objectives (2 months)</li>
                                <li><strong>Phase 3:</strong> Created dashboard infrastructure and trained teams on data-driven decision making processes (3 months)</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Key implementation components included:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Designing and building a CRM system tailored to the company's specific sales process and customer journey</li>
                                <li>Establishing a structured sales funnel with clear definitions, owner accountability, and conversion metrics at each stage</li>
                                <li>Developing dashboards that provided both operational metrics for teams and strategic insights for executive leadership</li>
                                <li>Creating a framework for shared objectives across departments to align efforts toward common growth goals</li>
                            </ul>
